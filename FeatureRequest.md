## Feature Requests

**There are a lot of ideas for further improvements, but only limited capacity on side of the developer.** Therefore I have created this page as a collection of ideas. 

1. Who ever has a new idea can put it here, so it that it is not forgotten. 

2. Who ever has time, capacity and passion to support, can take any of the ideas and implement them. 
   I will support and help where ever I can!

Extend the MQTT client to also enable callbacks for configuration setting

To do:

* implement callback for receiving information and override `config.ini` settings

* change configuration management to handle online updates (currently changes need a restart)

* think about the startup, as there the default config is loaded
